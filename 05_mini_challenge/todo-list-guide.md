# To-Do List Application - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview
สร้างเว็บแอปพลิเคชัน To-Do List ที่สมบูรณ์ พร้อมฟีเจอร์จัดการรายการสิ่งที่ต้องทำ ด้วย HTML, CSS, และ JavaScript แบบ vanilla

## 🚀 Quick Start Command for Copilot

### Option 1: One-Command Creation
To create this To-Do List application in one command, instruct Copilot:

```
Create a To-Do List web application with the following requirements:
- Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete
- Filter tasks by All/Active/Completed status  
- Local storage for data persistence
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Accessibility features and keyboard navigation
- Modern, clean UI with smooth animations
- All functionality in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Follow the user stories and acceptance criteria in todo-list-guide.md
```

### Option 2: Use Ready-to-Run Script
Execute the ready-made setup script:

```bash
# Navigate to the mini challenge folder
cd "05_mini_challenge"

# Run the setup script
./create-todo-app.sh

# Open the application
open todo-app/index.html
```

The script creates a complete, production-ready To-Do List application with all files and features.
